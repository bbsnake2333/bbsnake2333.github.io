           When the couple arrived in Los Angeles, the husband became fascinated by the plush casino and started betting on all the attractions. After four days, they had just two dollars left.

           "Let me go to the casino alone," the man told his wife. "I ve got a feeling that I'll be luck today."

           Once downstairs he went to the roulette table and put his last two dollars on No.14.red. His number won. He continued betting and winning. Within an hour, he had acquired $50000. Feeling that his luck was about to change, he picked up his chips and walked toward the cashier.

          "Just before he reached her, he felt one final urge to bet. He went back to the roulette table and put everything on No. 10, black. The wheel spun1 round and round, and finally stopped on No.12. red. Heartbroken, the fellow returned to his room.

          "Well," his wife asked anxiously, "How did you make out?"

          "I lost two dollars."

        "I have a lovely dog named Bobby.He looks pretty with short legs,big ears and short tail.He is my good friend and he is also easy to take care of.I walk him at least twice a day,feed him and spend time with him.He also gives his love to me in return.

        He is always there to lick me and lie on me.I like playing with him.I think he can tell when I am happy,sad,angry or troubled.Sometimes he can be noisy and run around the room.In a word,he is not only my dog,but also my friend.
            "

        "I love him. He can roll on the floor. He can play balls with me. He can look after my house when I am out. Bobby is very clever. But sometimes he isn’t.

        One day Bobby runs away. He is out for three days. After he comes back, I tie him to a tree and give him some food. Bobby begins to eat. But then he stops. He sees a fox. The fox is looking at his food. Bobby barks and barks. He wants to catch the fox. But he can’t. The fox runs round the tree. Bobby runs after the fox. So the rope goes ground the tree. Of course Bobby can’t run. Quickly he eats up the food and runs away.
